Converts output of NLS DABANK-PC HTML-Interface to CSV
  (NLS: Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Statistik)

Sample file: http://www.stadt-walsrode.de/media/custom/352_551_1.HTML
  (If you try it, add the missing </html> at the end.)

If the NLS changes their tables, this script will break horribly and you will notice only by closely examining the output: There is no error detection! You have been warned.

In case this script stops working, you might have to adjust the variables described with "Configuration values" in the sourcecode. Or maybe it is entirely broken...
